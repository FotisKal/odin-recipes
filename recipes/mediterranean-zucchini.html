        Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        Here's a delicious way to solve the problem of those too-big zucchini ballooning in your garden at the end of the summer: 
        zucchini boats baked and stuffed with lamb, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes, and other Mediterranean flavors!

    <h2>
        Ingredients
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 extra large zucchini, halved lengthwise
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1 sweet onion, chopped
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon chopped garlic
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pound ground lamb
        </li>
    </ul>

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds and pulp separately from the zucchini, 
            carving out each half and leaving about a half-inch shell. Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Discard seeds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. 
            Add ground lamb; continue to cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chopped zucchini into the lamb mixture. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until the zucchini is hot, about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease. Season lamb mixture with 
            coarse salt and black pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
